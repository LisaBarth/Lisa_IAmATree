## Core Concept
The journey of a tree subjected through three main stages. The first stage represents a happy, healthy, wonderful setting, followed by a disruptive, fearful, anxious state caused by the man-made destruction of nature. The final stage is a metaphysical open-ended question of reflection.

## Goal and Desired UX
- **First Stage**: Embody a tree. Make the immersant feel at peace, calm, and happy.
- **Second Stage**: Transition to feeling uncomfortable, helpless, and devastated as the tree experiences destruction.
- **Final Stage**: Reflect on the experience and hopefully desire to return to the peaceful, undestroyed nature from the beginning.

## Impact and Transformation
Increase connection to nature and evoke pro-environmental behavior in the real world.

## Target Audience
Anyone

## Questions for the Audience
### Variants of the Ending:
- **Take off HMD**: Dark, quiet environment + seeing/feeling a real tree, providing space for reflection.
- **"Look yourself in the mirror" self-reflection metaphor**: Disembody the tree, see the tree in a mirror in VR. Then take off HMD and see yourself in a physical mirror.
